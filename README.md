### j-chat

J-chat is an online chat server where users are able to connect to 'rooms' and chat to each other live

# Development

The structure is currently this way so I can eventually split these to run into their own containers:

```
git clone https://github.com/jansengsy/j-chat.git
cd j-chat
cd server
npm i
npm run dev
cd ../frontend
npm i
npm start
```
